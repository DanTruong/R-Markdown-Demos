This is a collection of R Markdown documents that demonstrates the analysis capabilities. R Markdown is a document generator that lets one write their analysis in R (or multiple other languages such as Python or SQL) and easily display their results in their report. This saves the writer time on having to copy and paste output results and charts when generating their report. More information on R Markdown can be found at http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/.
